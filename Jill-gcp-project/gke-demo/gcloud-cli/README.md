# Creating GKE Clusters using gcloud Command-line Tool

This directory provides instructions and examples for creating Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the `gcloud` command-line tool. The `gcloud` tool allows you to manage GCP resources and interact with GKE clusters from the command line.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Google Cloud Platform account.
- Installed and set up the `gcloud` command-line tool.
- Familiarity with basic Kubernetes concepts.

## Steps

Follow these steps to create a GKE cluster using the `gcloud` command-line tool:

1. **Authentication and Project Setup**:
   - Open a terminal window and authenticate using the `gcloud auth login` command.
   - Set your default project using `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`.

2. **Create a Cluster**:

     gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-gke-cluster --region us-central1 --project scenic-block-363003

   - Use the following command to create a GKE cluster:
     ```bash
     gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME --zone ZONE
     ```
   - Replace `CLUSTER_NAME` with the desired cluster name and `ZONE` with the preferred zone.

3. **Additional Configuration**:
   - Use `gcloud` commands to modify cluster configuration, such as adding node pools, enabling APIs, and specifying machine types.

4. **Authentication to the Cluster**:
   - Configure authentication to the cluster using the following command:
     ```bash
     gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME --zone ZONE
     ```
   - This command updates your `kubeconfig` file to include the cluster's credentials.

5. **Interact with Your Cluster**:
   - Once the cluster is ready, you can use `kubectl` commands to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
   - Deploy applications, manage workloads, and scale resources as needed.
