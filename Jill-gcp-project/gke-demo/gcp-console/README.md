# Creating GKE Clusters using GCP Console

This directory contains instructions and examples for creating Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the GCP Console. The GCP Console provides a user-friendly interface for managing and deploying GKE clusters.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Google Cloud Platform account.
- Familiarity with basic Kubernetes concepts.
- Access to the GCP Console.

## Steps

Follow these steps to create a GKE cluster using the GCP Console:

1. **Login to GCP Console**: Log in to your GCP account and navigate to the Google Cloud Console.

2. **Navigate to Kubernetes Engine**: From the navigation menu, select "Kubernetes Engine" under "Containers".

3. **Create a Cluster**:
   - Click the "Create Cluster" button.
   - Configure cluster settings:
     - **Cluster Basics**: Provide a name for your cluster and select the desired region/zone.
     - **Networking(optional)**: Customize the default selection of network, subnet, and network access to desired.
   - Click "Create" to initiate cluster creation.

4. **Monitor Cluster Creation**: The GCP Console will display the progress of cluster creation. You can also view cluster details, node status, and more.

5. **Access Kubernetes Dashboard** (Optional):
   - From the "Kubernetes Engine" section, click "Clusters".
   - Find your cluster in the list and click the "Connect" button.
   - Choose "Run in Cloud Shell" or use the provided `gcloud` command to configure access to the cluster.

6. **Interact with Your Cluster**:
   - Once the cluster is ready, you can use `kubectl` commands to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
   - Deploy applications, manage workloads, and scale resources as needed.
